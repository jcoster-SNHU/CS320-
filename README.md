Adding final project and code resources for final journal
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?:

The best way to ensure your code remains functional and secure is to stay up to date with the latest security vulnerabilities and updates alongside running relevant tests during development to test for any potential future bugs or backdoors. To keep something functioning in the longterm constant maintenence is required as new threats pop up every day. Storing your code in a secure database is also crucial, in my opinion keeping the program on a cloud based platform like AWS, will help make sure the application is on the most up to date and secure platform. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?:

During the software development lifecycle, taking the time to meet with the potential user base to collect requirements along with constant testing throughout the development process will help you keep the scope of the project focused on user needs. Sometimes as developers we have bias towards our builds that can lead to nearsighted features only designed with us in mind, but keeping feedback going with users helps you see other viewpoints for a more complete user experience.

How do I approach designing software?:

I like to make sure that when I start a new software build I approach it with a well thought out plan and to follow the agile development method. I go through the steps of the software development lifecycle to make sure I hit all the needed design phases and collecting customer requirements before starting the coding process. I try to test and confirm different modules are functional before the end and remember that the project is always evolving and features can change and adapt as the build goes on.
